# Project title

Start the README file by stating the name of your project or the name of your repository.

## Project description

We recommend that you provide a short description of your project, making sure to include relevant keywords for indexing. 
The goal of this repository is to provide you with _template files_ that help you initialize your repository and that you can modify to fit your own needs and your own project.

Then it is important to state the names of the authors and contributors of the project. 
The contributors of this repository and the included template files are Cécile Hardebolle, Pierre-Olivier Vallès and Patrick Jermann, from the Center for Digital Education at EPFL.

It is good practice to include the public URL of your repository.  
This repository is available at: https://c4science.ch/source/noto-poc-notebooks/

And finally, contact information can also be helpful.  
For any enquiries relating to this template or this repository, please contact: [noto-support@groupes.epfl.ch](mailto:noto-support@groupes.epfl.ch)
